This is the README file for project 'sutil' by Alexandre Botao (botao dot org)


'sutil' is a collection of software  - programs, libraries and scripts
developed along a few decades (since 1983),
with the purpose to assist, expedite, optimize and improve 
operating system support and operating system administration efficiency 
on unix and linux platforms.


about the licenses: 

	not all programs and scritps have the same license;

	but all licences used are meant to mean "free open source software" ("foss" for short).


about the 'bud' source tree: 

	*** the 'gnu-toolchain'-like stuff found there 
		is intended for very old environments
		where the 'true-gnu' toolchain didn't fit or 
		simply were not available (back in the day) 
		because it had not been invented or ported to some architecture ***

	anyway, just cd to the 'bud' directory and pretend it's gnu - like:

		./configure ; make ; make install

	*** and to refresh, just:

		make clean ; ./configure -c ; ./configure -u


be advised:

	most of these programs are still under active development and evolution;

	when appropriate, some versions are marked 'stable';

	'nightly' releases are just that - no warranties as usual;



============================================================================================================

	*** VERY IMPORTANT *** 

		although quite a few programs here are expressly meant to be executed 'as root',

		never - ever - use ANY OTHER program (not just these here) with 'root' privileges 

		unless you absolutely undoubtedly know very well what you are doing,

		and you are prepared to clean up any consequential mess.
