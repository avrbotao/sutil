This is the README file for project 'sutil' by Alexandre Botao (botao.org)

'sutil' is a collection of programs designed to assist, expedite, optimize and improve technical support and system administration efficiency on unix and linux platforms.

some of these programs (eg. 'vdt', 'swet', 'pha') have their separate websites - with the same [or updated] source code found here.

*** the 'gnu-toolchain'-like stuff found here is intended for very old environments where the 'true-gnu' toolchain didn't fit (back in the day) ***

anyway, just cd to the 'bud' directory and pretend it's gnu:

./configure
make
make install

*** to refresh:

make clean
./configure -c
./configure -u
